# Prism - Native AI Chat for macOS

![Prism App Icon](AppIcon.png)

## Overview

Prism is a cutting-edge, native macOS application designed to be your ultimate AI companion. Built with SwiftUI, it offers a seamless and visually stunning "Liquid Glass" interface that feels right at home on your Mac. 

Unlike other chat apps, Prism isn't locked to a single AI provider. It empowers you to choose the right tool for the job:
*   **Google Gemini:** Harness the power of Google's latest cloud models for complex reasoning and multimodal analysis.
*   **Ollama:** Run privacy-focused local models (like Llama 3, DeepSeek, and Mistral) directly on your machine with zero data leaving your device.
*   **Apple Shortcuts:** Deeply integrate with your Mac's system automation to control apps and workflows.

Whether you're solving complex math equations with beautiful LaTeX rendering, analyzing images, or just need a quick answer via the lightweight "Quick Chat" window, Prism delivers with streaming performance and a user-centric design.
